- ðŸ‘‹ Sup fellow websurfers, I'm @Darthsniper15 aka Pen/Î£Ï„Ï…Î»ÏŒ, a begginer coder and keratoconus carrier that for now only code for hobby due to work.
- But I dream that I can live only coding.
- I have my portfolio that you can acess using "https://caneta.dev.br"
- I'm developing a DB of Arknights in PT-BR, inspired by Acesip DB.
- I will code a DB of Blue Archive, maybe one for others games... maybe...
- You can find me on Twitter, Pinterest, Ko-Fi(if for some reason you want to give me a incentive) and Discord using @DarthSniper15, but you can also find my using Î£Ï„Ï…Î»ÏŒ.
- By the way, I'm from Brazil, so my mother language isn't english, any inconsistence, it's because of it.
- Take care and stay safe everyone.
